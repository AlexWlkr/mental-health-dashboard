# Mental Health Dashboard

This is project 3 in my frontend development portfolio â€” a minimum viable product (MVP) for a tool I wish existed: a clean, filterable dashboard that helps people find local mental health programs.

Itâ€™s designed for students, families, and community members in Baltimore who are often left out of tech solutions. You can filter by program type, audience, or accessibility needs like Spanish-language services or virtual care. The data is mock for now, but the structure is real and ready to scale.

### Why I Built This
I wanted to create a tool that helps people quickly find mental health support that fits their real lives â€” whether that means virtual care, programs in Spanish, or peer-led groups. One of my first roles was as a Community Engagement Coordinator with the State Office of Suicide Prevention, where I led digital campaigns that connected people to these exact types of resources.

Building this dashboard felt like a natural extension of that mission â€” just now, with code. Itâ€™s also been a chance to apply what Iâ€™m learning in frontend development to a real-world problem I care deeply about, while practicing filtering logic, data visualization, and accessible design along the way.

Iâ€™m currently learning frontend development through [Skillcrush](https://skillcrush.com), and this project helped me put core concepts into practice while building something that reflects both my values and my technical growth.

### Built With
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Chart.js for data visualizations
- Flexbox layout and media queries for responsiveness
- Accessible alt text, semantic HTML, and keyboard nav (in progress)

### Features
- Filter mental health programs by:
  - Type (Peer Support, Therapy, etc.)
  - Audience (Youth, Adults, Family, LGBTQIA+)
  - Accessibility (Spanish, Virtual, In-Person, ASL, etc.)
- Interactive bar charts breaking down:
  - Program types
  - Audience served
  - Accessibility options

### Whatâ€™s Next
This is an MVP â€” the goal was to build a functional foundation. Future improvements Iâ€™d like to add include:
- A real backend/API with live data
- More robust keyboard navigation and skip links
- Light/dark mode toggle
- Search functionality and program bookmarking

### About Me
Iâ€™m Alex Walker â€” a social media manager and strategist turned frontend developer with a masterâ€™s in clinical social work. For the past four years, Iâ€™ve led digital campaigns focused on mental health, suicide prevention, and social impact, helping connect underserved communities to life-changing resources.

Now, Iâ€™m applying that same energy to tech. Iâ€™m currently completing the Skillcrush frontend developer program and building projects that reflect both my technical growth and my commitment to equity. My background helps me think about accessibility, community needs, and real-world use cases â€” not just code.

Iâ€™m looking for a junior developer role on a mission-driven team, ideally where tech, storytelling, and impact intersect.

Letâ€™s build something that matters.

Alex Walker
